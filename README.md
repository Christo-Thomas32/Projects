Analysing and Predicting a sample  data from Kaggle and testing the accuracy using the sample of the same data
The data i used is a sample data downloaded from Kaggle, for a simple project as a part of my course. I used the data and represented it on charts and did a prediction,
by creating a simple model. And tested its accuracy using linear regression method.
